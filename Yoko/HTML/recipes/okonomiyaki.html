						<h2>INGREDIENTS </h2>
						<h3> Yield: Two 7-inch pancakes</h3>
						<p> 
							1 teaspoon hondashi (bonito soup stock) or instant dashi <br>
							2 large eggs<br>
							¾ cup all-purpose flour<br>
							1½ teaspoons kosher salt<br>
							½ teaspoon baking powder<br>
							¼ teaspoon baking soda<br>
							4 cups finely shredded green cabbage (about ½ pound)<br>
							1 cup thinly sliced scallions (about 5 scallions)<br>
							1 tablespoon drained pickled red ginger (or finely chopped pickled sushi ginger)<br>
							¼ cup safflower or canola oil<br>
							3 ounces sliced pork belly or bacon, cut crosswise into 5-inch pieces<br>
							
							Okonomi sauce, Kewpie mayonnaise, dried shaved bonito and shredded nori, for serving
						</p>

						
						<h2>PREPARATION </h2>
						<p> 
							Step 1 <br>
							In a large bowl, combine hondashi with 1 cup water and whisk until dissolved. Whisk in eggs until well combined. Add flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda and whisk until smooth. Fold in cabbage, scallions and ginger until well incorporated. <br>

							Step 2<br>
							In an 8-inch nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Add half the batter, spreading cabbage mixture into an even 6-inch round about 1-inch thick (resist the urge to push down on the mixture). Arrange half the pork belly over the cabbage, slightly overlapping. Cook over medium-low until pancake is set and golden brown underneath, 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and carefully flip pancake by inverting onto a plate then slipping back into the skillet.<br>

							Step 3<br>
							Cook until golden brown on second side, pancake is cooked through in center and pork is lightly golden, about 8 minutes. Transfer pancake, pork side up, onto a large plate. Wipe out skillet and repeat with remaining oil, batter and pork belly.<br>
							
							Step 4 <br>
							Drizzle pancakes with okonomi sauce and Kewpie mayonnaise, then top with a handful of shaved bonito and nori. Serve warm. <br>
